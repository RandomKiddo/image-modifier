# Frequently Asked Questions

**Will this package ever be added to PyPI?**

The future is uncertain. When Version 3.0 is released, `image-modifier` may be added to PyPI as a python3 package. However, there is no guarantee for this to occur, as there is not much demand to have this distribution on PyPI. Until then, continue to download the `modifier.py` binary and then use it. Also, `image-modifier` has many dependencies, and thus would cause issues on PyPI importation. It is being considered, but there is no guarantee for this to happen.

**How do I request things to be added to the distribution?**

You have a couple options here. If you wish for the enhancement to be on this repository, you can file an issue under the `Issues` tab using the template for a 
feature request, and it could be considered. On the other hand, you may fork this repository and add the feature for yourself, as long as it follows the guidelines
under the `LaTeX Project Public License v1.3c`
